# Golden Lab Forex Expert Advisor

This Expert Advisor implements a TDI-based strategy for trading on Golden Lab Forex. It uses the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average (MA) indicators to generate buy and sell signals. The input parameters can be adjusted to customize the trading strategy.

## Input Parameters
- RSI_Period: The period for calculating the RSI indicator.
- MA_Period: The period for calculating the Moving Average indicator.
- StopLoss: The stop loss level in pips.
- TakeProfit: The take profit level in pips.

## How it Works
The Expert Advisor starts by getting the current bid and ask prices. It then calculates the RSI and Moving Average values. If the RSI is below 30 (oversold) and the bid price is above the Moving Average, a buy signal is generated. If the RSI is above 70 (overbought) and the bid price is below the Moving Average, a sell signal is generated.

## Buy Signal Generation
When a buy signal is generated, the Expert Advisor calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the current ask price. It then places a buy order with the calculated levels.

## Sell Signal Generation
When a sell signal is generated, the Expert Advisor calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the current bid price. It then places a sell order with the calculated levels.
